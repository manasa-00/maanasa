<p><h3><i><center>A virtual machine, commonly shortened to just VM, is no different than any other physical computer like a laptop, smart phone, or server. It has a CPU, memory, disks to store your files, and can connect to the internet if needed. While the parts that make up your computer (called hardware) are physical and tangible, VMs are often thought of as virtual computers or software-defined computers within physical servers, existing only as code.</center></i></p></h3>

<section><h2><u>TYPES OF VIRTUAL MACHINE</u> : </h2></section>
<p><h2><i>1) Process virtual machine : </h2> <h3><center>A process virtual machine is defined as a type of virtual machine that allows only a single process to run as an application.</center></h3></i></p>
<h2><i>2) System virtual machine : </h2><h3><center> A system virtual machine is defined as a type of virtual machine that is fully virtualized to substitute a physical machine.</center></h3> 

<h2><u>USES OF VIRTUAL MACHINE</u> : </h2>
<p><h3><i><li> Device Backup<br><li> Testing<br><li> Program Development<br><li> Cyber Security</h3></p>

<h2><u>WORKING OF VIRTUAL MACHINE</u> : </h2>
<h3><li> Virtualization provides with dedicated software based memory, CPU and storage.<br>
<li> The overall process is then done by the hypervisor software.<br>
<li> According to the need the resources are being moved from the host towards the guest by the hypervisor. Hypervisor also schedules the operations in virtual machines in order to avoid the conflicts that can arise while using the resources.<br>
<li> As virtual machine is separated from the remaining system, it has no access to make any unapproved modifications to the host computer systems.<br>
<li> This is done for preventing the virtual machines from interfering with the central operating systems of the host.</h3>

<h2><u>EXAMPLES OF VIRTUAL MACHINE</u> : </h2>
